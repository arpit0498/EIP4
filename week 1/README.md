1.Convolution:It is like traversing the whole image by using kernel to extract features.

2.Filters/Kernels:Also known as "feature extractor".It is in the form of a matrix and it extracts the features from the image.

3.Epochs:Iterating the whole dataset which is divided into batches in one time is known as 1 Epoch.

4.1x1 Convolution:It means having 1x1 channels which consists of the features of an image output.

5.3x3 Convolution:It iterates on an image by 3x3 and reduce dimension value by 2.

6.Feature Maps:It is collection of features from the channels.

7.Activation Function:It is an non-linear function which hepls to obtain essential features.

8.Receptive Field:In simple words ,we can say that how many pixels it can see in the original image.
